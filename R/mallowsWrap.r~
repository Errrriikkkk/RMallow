#' Generate any sort of Mallows model on ranking data.
#' 
#' The currently types of developed Mallows models include the standard model on full rankings,
#' the standard model on partial rankings, the Mallows mixture on full rankings, and the Mallows
#' mixture on partial rankings (soon to be Generalized Mallows on full, generalized on partial, 
#' generalized mixtures on full, and generalized mixtures on partial).
#' 
#' @param ranks An object of class 'ranking' or 'mallows', or a matrix or data frame that can be
#' converted to such an object.
#' @param G The number of mixture components to be used
#' @param iter The number of iterations to try to attain convergence
#' @param hyp A list of hypothesized modal sequence(s) to try to acheive or find a sequence close to
#' @param cores The number of cores used to perform the search, if necessary
#' @param grouping A variable to group the sequences by, if there is believed to be an underlying
#' clustering variable.  This variable will not be used to cluster.
#' @param method If desired, the branch-and-bound algorithm will be used.
#' @param type Should we use a Generalized Mallows model (a weighted metric) or a standard Mallows
#' model (each transposition of items has the same cost).
#' @param top.bound a vector of the top bounds on the lambda parameters, if desired.
#' @return The model fit
